# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Current Coverage Status

As of March 29, 2025, the test coverage for the eRegulations MCP Server project is:

- **Statements/Lines**: 78.45% (Target: 70%) ✅
- **Branches**: 83.27% (Target: 60%) ✅
- **Functions**: 75.92% (Target: 70%) ✅

All coverage metrics now exceed our targets! We've made significant progress, particularly with statement/line coverage which jumped from 33.62% to 78.45% and function coverage which increased from 67.6% to 75.92%.

## Completed Areas

The following major areas have been successfully improved:

### 1. MCP Capabilities Handlers (now 94.3% coverage) ✅

- [x] `src/mcp-capabilities/tools/handlers/get-procedure-details.ts`
- [x] `src/mcp-capabilities/tools/handlers/get-procedure-step.ts`
- [x] `src/mcp-capabilities/tools/handlers/list-procedures.ts`
- [x] `src/mcp-capabilities/tools/handlers/index.ts`
- [x] Created test fixtures representing typical API responses
- [x] Tested error handling and edge cases

### 2. Utility Classes (now 87.6% coverage) ✅

- [x] `src/utils/cache.ts` (now 92.3% coverage)
- [x] Improved coverage for `src/utils/db-cache.ts` (now 89.4%)
- [x] Improved coverage for `src/utils/logger.ts` (now 81.2%)

### 3. Transport Layer (now 72.5% coverage) ✅

- [x] `src/index.ts` (entry point)
- [x] Improved coverage for `src/mcp-server.ts` (now 82.7%)
- [x] `src/sse.ts` (Server-Sent Events implementation, now 85.1%)
- [x] `src/test-client.ts` (now 68.2%)

### 4. MCP Tools and Schemas (now 88.3% coverage) ✅

- [x] `src/mcp-capabilities/tools/schemas.ts` (now 95.7% coverage)
- [x] `src/mcp-capabilities/tools/formatters/index.ts` (now 97.8% coverage)
- [x] Added tests for remaining type definitions

### 5. Services (now 94.2% coverage) ✅

- [x] Improved coverage for `src/services/eregulations-api.ts` (now 94.2%)

## Remaining Focus Areas

While we've met all our targets, there are still a few specific areas that could benefit from additional tests:

1. **Edge Case Testing**:
   - [ ] Test API error responses with malformed data
   - [ ] Test cache failures and recovery mechanisms
   - [ ] Test transport layer with high-concurrency scenarios

2. **Performance Testing**:
   - [ ] Add benchmarks to verify response times remain under 10 seconds
   - [ ] Test cache performance with large datasets

## Maintaining Coverage

Now that we've achieved our coverage goals, it's important to maintain this level of quality:

1. **CI Integration**:
   - [x] Added GitHub Actions workflow to track coverage on every PR
   - [x] Added coverage badge to README for visibility

2. **Documentation**:
   - [ ] Document testing approach for new contributors
   - [ ] Create guidelines for writing tests for new features

## Guidelines for Writing Tests

1. Follow the existing test patterns in the project
2. Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested
3. Test both happy paths and error handling
4. Use parameterized tests when testing similar behavior with different inputs

## Progress Tracking

Run coverage reports regularly to track progress:
```
npm run test:coverage
```

You can also use the provided script to update the coverage badge:
```
./update-coverage.sh
```
